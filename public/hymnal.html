    <h2>Put the gun in your hand, little Omar</h2>
    <p class="melody">Baltimore version of Put in your hand Mrs. Murphy</p>
    <p class="purpose">a down down song</p>
    <p>
      Put the gun in your hand, little Omar<br/>
      It only holds a couple dozen rounds<br/>
      It's long, black and shiny like a crowbar<br/>
      And when you pull the trigger they go down, down, down, down

    <h2>The Mayor of Bayswater</h2>
    <p class="purpose">to welcome the hares</p>

    <strong>verse</strong><br/>
    <p>
      The mayor of Bayswater<br/>
      He had a lovely daughter<br/>
      And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
      Hung down to her knees<br/>
    </p>

    <strong>chorus</strong><br/>
    <p>
      And the hairs<br/>
      And the hairs<br/>
      And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
      Hung down to her knees<br/>
    </p>

    <strong>other verses</strong><br/>
    <p>
      One black one, one white one,<br/>
      One with a little shite on,<br/>
      And one with a little light on<br/>
      To show us the way<br/>
    </p>

    <p>
      They're so soft and spongey<br/>
      You can use them for a bungie<br/>
      And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
      Hung down to her knees<br/>
    </p>

    <p>
      I've smelt it, I've felt it<br/>
      It's just like a piece of velvet<br/>
      And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
            Hung down to her knees<br/>
          </p>

    <p>
      She came from Glamorgan<br/>
      With a cunt like a barrel organ<br/>
      And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
            Hung down to her knees<br/>
          </p>

    <p>
      She married an Italian<br/>
      Who was hung like a fucking stallion<br/>
      And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
            Hung down to her knees<br/>
          </p>

    <p>
      She divorced the Italian<br/>
      And married a fucking stallion<br/>
      And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
            Hung down to her knees<br/>
          </p>

    <p>
      Her cat's name was Boris<br/>
      And it played with her clitoris<br/>
      And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
            Hung down to her knees<br/>
          </p>

    <p>
      She shays she's not a whore<br/>
      But she bangs like a shit-house door<br/>
      And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
            Hung down to her knees<br/>
          </p>

    <p>
      She went to Arabia<br/>
      And got camel-drool on her labia<br/>
      And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
            Hung down to her knees<br/>
          </p>

    <p>
      She married a Spaniard<br/>
      With a prick like a bloody lanyard<br/>
      And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
            Hung down to her knees<br/>
          </p>

    <p>
      She stayed in Seattle<br/>
      And went down on cattle<br/>
      And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
            Hung down to her knees<br/>
          </p>

    <p>
      I've licked it, I've kissed it<br/>
      It tastes like a chocolate biscuit<br/>
      And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
            Hung down to her knees<br/>
          </p>

    <p>
      Her vagina is squishy<br/>
      And smells a bit fishy<br/>
      And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
            Hung down to her knees<br/>
          </p>

    <p>
      The aroma, it lingers<br/>
      It smells like fish fingers<br/>
      And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
            Hung down to her knees<br/>
          </p>
    
    <p>(And so on...)</p>
