          <h4>CCH3 #1</h4>
          <p><strong>Why</strong>: because you need another excuse to hash!  plus now we're in your backyard!</p>
          <p><strong>When</strong>: Thursday, May 26.  Sign-in / prelube at 6:30PM, hares away at 7PM.  Pack away at 7:15PM.</p>
          <p><strong>Hares</strong>: ATM and GAP</p>
          <p><strong>Where</strong>: Riptide by the Bay ($2 Boh draft prelubes), 1718 Thames Street</p>
          <p><strong>Public Transit Options</strong>: Orange Line to Aliceanna & Central, walk the last 5 blocks.  The 13 to Washington & Eastern, walk the last 5 blocks.</p>
          <p><strong>Cost</strong>: Hash cash is $4, but bring $5 for stops on trail (plus whatever you'll spend prelubing).</p>
          <p><strong>Theme</strong>: John Waters.  Appropriately Baltimore.  Pre-hash requirement: watch Pink Flamingos, pick your favorite outfit and wear it to the hash!  I'm sure between The Love Zone and Salvation Army stores on Broadway you'll be able to pull together an outfit.</p>
          <p>Circle + on after on my roof (817 S Broadway)</p>
          <p><strong>Friendlies</strong>: shiggy rating = 0, this is a city trail.  Bring $5 (or more if you like) + ID on trail, you'll need it.  I may have some burgers/dogs to cook up after circle at my place.  And who knows there may even be some four loko leftover.</p></p>
