          <h4>CCH3 #1</h4>
          <p><strong>Why</strong>: because you need another excuse to hash!  plus now we're in your backyard!</p>
          <p><strong>When</strong>: Thursday, May 26.  Sign-in / prelube at 6:30PM, hares away at 7PM.  Pack away at 7:15PM.</p>
          <p><strong>Hares</strong>: ATM and GAP</p>
          <p><strong>Where</strong>: Riptide by the Bay ($2 Boh draft prelubes), 1718 Thames Street</p>
          <p><strong>Public Transit Options</strong>: Orange Line to Aliceanna & Central, walk the last 5 blocks.  The 13 to Washington & Eastern, walk the last 5 blocks.</p>
          <p><strong>Cost</strong>: Hash cash is $4, but bring $5 for stops on trail (plus whatever you'll spend prelubing).</p>
          <p><strong>Theme</strong>: John Waters.  Appropriately Baltimore.  Pre-hash requirement: watch Pink Flamingos, pick your favorite outfit and wear it to the hash!  I'm sure between The Love Zone and Salvation Army stores on Broadway you'll be able to pull together an outfit.</p>
          <p>Circle + on after on my roof (817 S Broadway)</p>
          <p><strong>Friendlies</strong>: shiggy rating = 0, this is a city trail.  Bring $5 (or more if you like) + ID on trail, you'll need it.  I may have some burgers/dogs to cook up after circle at my place.  And who knows there may even be some four loko leftover.</p></p>

      <strong>verse</strong><br/>
      <p>
        The mayor of Bayswater<br/>
        He had a lovely daughter<br/>
        And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
        Hung down to her knees<br/>
      </p>

      <strong>chorus</strong><br/>
      <p>
        And the hairs<br/>
        And the hairs<br/>
        And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
        Hung down to her knees<br/>
      </p>

      <strong>other verses</strong><br/>
      <p>
        One black one, one white one,<br/>
        One with a little shite on,<br/>
        And one with a little light on<br/>
        To show us the way<br/>
      </p>

      <p>
        They're so soft and spongey<br/>
        You can use them for a bungie<br/>
        And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
        Hung down to her knees<br/>
      </p>

      <p>
        I've smelt it, I've felt it<br/>
        It's just like a piece of velvet<br/>
        And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
              Hung down to her knees<br/>
            </p>

      <p>
        She came from Glamorgan<br/>
        With a cunt like a barrel organ<br/>
        And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
              Hung down to her knees<br/>
            </p>

      <p>
        She married an Italian<br/>
        Who was hung like a fucking stallion<br/>
        And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
              Hung down to her knees<br/>
            </p>

      <p>
        She divorced the Italian<br/>
        And married a fucking stallion<br/>
        And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
              Hung down to her knees<br/>
            </p>

      <p>
        Her cat's name was Boris<br/>
        And it played with her clitoris<br/>
        And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
              Hung down to her knees<br/>
            </p>

      <p>
        She shays she's not a whore<br/>
        But she bangs like a shit-house door<br/>
        And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
              Hung down to her knees<br/>
            </p>

      <p>
        She went to Arabia<br/>
        And got camel-drool on her labia<br/>
        And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
              Hung down to her knees<br/>
            </p>

      <p>
        She married a Spaniard<br/>
        With a prick like a bloody lanyard<br/>
        And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
              Hung down to her knees<br/>
            </p>

      <p>
        She stayed in Seattle<br/>
        And went down on cattle<br/>
        And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
              Hung down to her knees<br/>
            </p>

      <p>
        I've licked it, I've kissed it<br/>
        It tastes like a chocolate biscuit<br/>
        And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
              Hung down to her knees<br/>
            </p>

      <p>
        Her vagina is squishy<br/>
        And smells a bit fishy<br/>
        And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
              Hung down to her knees<br/>
            </p>

      <p>
        The aroma, it lingers<br/>
        It smells like fish fingers<br/>
        And the hairs of her dickey-di-do<br/>
              Hung down to her knees<br/>
            </p>
