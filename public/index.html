          <h4>CCH3 #7</h4>
          <p><strong>Hares</strong>: Monk She See, Monk She Blew and Quick With MILF</p>
          <p><strong>What</strong>: 
            Theme is not yet disclosed but keep your eyes out for more details to
            come from your hares Quick with MILF and Monk She See, Monk She
            Blew.

            This will be MILF's last CCH3 trail before he is locked away for the
            year, so it'd be cool if all you Wankers can make it to trail and
            offer him some advice on survival in the slammer.
          </p>
          <p><strong>When</strong>: Monday, November 21</p>
          <p><strong>Where</strong>: Inner Harbor/Fells Point, exact location TBD</p>
          <p><strong>Cost</strong>: $5</p>
          <p><strong>Why</strong>: Because it's been too long since you've worn panties on your head and ran around like a fool</p>
